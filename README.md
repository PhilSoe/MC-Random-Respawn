# MC-Random-Respawn
A Minecraft data pack which gives you a random spawn point in a 20000 block radius.

This pack is perfect for making death a larger setback, allowing you to stumble accross your former bases through exploration.

## Features:
This pack teleports you when you first join the world or when you die without a valid bed / other spawn point.

This pack also hides your coordinates and displays them only while holding a compass.
